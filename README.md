# Machine Learning Methods for Nano-Optics

## Project Overview
This project focuses on applying machine learning methods to analyze data from Scanning Near-Field Optical Microscopy (SNOM) experiments. By combining experimental and theoretical data, we aim to predict material properties using machine learning models such as k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). 

## Goals
1. Develop and validate machine learning models to analyze SNOM data.
2. Integrate theoretical (Maxwell's equations) and experimental data in a hybrid approach.
3. Compare the performance of purely experimental models versus hybrid models.

## Quick Start
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nano-optics-ml.git
   cd nano-optics-ml

   pip install -e .
